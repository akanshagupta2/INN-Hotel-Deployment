# INN-Hotel-Deployment
# Problem Statement

The INN Hotels Group has been facing a growing challenge with increased booking cancellations, peaking in the last 3 months with an inventory loss of 18%, resulting in a revenue loss of approximately $0.25 million annually. This issue is seriously affecting the groupâ€™s profitability.

Currently, inventory refers to a hotel room, and an unsold room due to cancellation leads to inventory loss.

Despite using heuristic, rule-based approaches and domain expertise, their current methods have not been effective or scalable, leading to continued high losses.

# Objective

To develop a Data Science-based predictive model that forecasts the likelihood of a booking being canceled. This will enable the business to:

Take proactive actions against high-risk bookings.
Minimize revenue loss due to cancellations.
Improve inventory management and operational efficiency.

# Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA and Visualisation)
Scikit-learn (ML Models)

# Outcome
A predictive model capable of classifying whether a booking is likely to be canceled or not, helping INN Hotels Group:
Optimize booking strategy
Reduce last-minute cancellations
Improve annual revenue and efficiency
